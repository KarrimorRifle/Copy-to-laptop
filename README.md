Here are some research topics related to Web Architecture and HTTP Evolution that would likely align with your lecture:

1. History of HTTP and Its Evolution
HTTP/0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2, and 3: Focus on how each version of the HTTP protocol introduced improvements to performance, reliability, and security. Study how these changes impacted web architecture over time.
Transition from TCP to QUIC (HTTP/3): Explore the shift from TCP-based connections in HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 to QUIC, the protocol behind HTTP/3. Analyze how this evolution improves performance, security, and efficiency in modern web architectures.
2. Architectural Changes Driven by HTTP Evolution
Client-Server Model and Beyond: Explore how the classical client-server model adapted with each new version of HTTP and the architectural changes required to support modern web applications (e.g., microservices, serverless computing, and edge computing).
Caching Mechanisms: Investigate how caching mechanisms (like proxy caching, ETag headers, and cache control in HTTP/1.1) evolved to optimize performance and scalability in web architectures.
Statelessness of HTTP and Web Services: Analyze how the stateless nature of HTTP influenced modern web service architectures, like RESTful APIs, and the need for session management technologies (e.g., cookies, JWT tokens).
3. Performance Enhancements in HTTP
Pipelining and Multiplexing (HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2): Research how pipelining and multiplexing improved web performance by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel rather than sequentially, which was a bottleneck in early versions of HTTP.
Header Compression (HPACK in HTTP/2, QPACK in HTTP/3): Investigate how header compression techniques in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 reduced overhead, especially in modern web services like Single Page Applications (SPAs).
4. Security Implications of HTTP Protocols
HTTPS Everywhere: Look into how the introduction of SSL/TLS became ubiquitous with HTTP/1.1 and enforced in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, leading to the concept of HTTPS by default, improving web security practices.
Security Improvements in HTTP/3 (QUIC): Examine how HTTP/3’s use of QUIC provides built-in encryption, resistance to certain attacks (like head-of-line blocking), and faster, more secure handshakes, impacting cloud service security architectures.
5. Web API Design and HTTP
RESTful Web Services: Study how RESTful API architecture leverages the stateless nature of HTTP to build scalable and maintainable web services. Discuss how modern web applications like cloud services depend on HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
GraphQL vs. REST: Explore the limitations of HTTP in RESTful APIs and how GraphQL aims to overcome them, focusing on how these two architectures differ in performance and flexibility in handling HTTP requests.
6. HTTP/2 and Microservices
Impact on Microservices: Investigate how HTTP/2’s multiplexing and improved request/response model aids in the performance and scalability of microservices architectures. Explore the architectural shift from monolithic applications to microservices driven by HTTP advancements.
Service Meshes: Analyze the role of HTTP/2 in service meshes (e.g., Istio) and how it improves communication between microservices through features like mutual TLS (mTLS), tracing, and service discovery.
7. Architecting for HTTP/3 in Cloud Environments
Cloud-Native Architecture with HTTP/3: Investigate how cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) are adapting their web services to support HTTP/3 and QUIC, and how this impacts cloud-native architecture in terms of security and performance.
Edge Computing and HTTP/3: Look into how HTTP/3 optimizes performance in edge computing scenarios, where low-latency connections and reduced round-trips are critical for fast, reliable data transmission.
These topics should align well with your lecture material and provide additional depth to your understanding of modern web architectures and the evolution of HTTP.
